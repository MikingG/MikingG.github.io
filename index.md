# About me

I enrolled in the Software Engineering School at Sun Yat-sen University in September 2021 as an undergraduate student. Currently, I am conducting research under the guidance of Assistant Professor Yanling Wang. Prior to this, I worked with Associate Professor Xiaoyu He, participating in the National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. During that time, our research focused on gradient-free federated learning methods based on evolutionary computation.

In addition to my academic endeavors, I have a passion for sharing knowledge and have authored almost 100 original blogs, which are published on CSDN, a prominent Chinese software development community.

My research interests are broad, encompassing large language models, software engineering, and deep learning, with a particular focus on intelligent software engineering.

# Project

## Gradient-Free Federated Learning Methods Based on Evolutionary Computation

Description: During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work with Associate Professor Xiaoyu He as part of the National Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Our research primarily focused on developing gradient-free federated learning methods using evolutionary computation. This innovative approach aimed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of federated learning, making it a viable option for various practical applications.

## SSE_MARKET

Description: SSE_MARKET is a communication platform specifically designed for teachers and students at the School of Software Engineering (SSE) at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). This platform aims to facilitate seamless interaction and the exchange of information within the academic community.

- For PC access, please visit [ssemarket.cn/pc](http://ssemarket.cn/pc).
- For mobile device access, please visit [ssemarket.cn/mb](http://ssemarket.cn/mb).

As the team leader of this project, I have overseen the development and implementation of the platform, ensuring that it meets the needs of SSE.

## CLUB_HUB

Description: CLUB_HUB is a platform dedicated to managing student clubs and facilitating club recruitment at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU). The platform serves as a comprehensive resource for students interested in joining clubs and for club leaders seeking new members.
